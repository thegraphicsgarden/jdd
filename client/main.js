  text: '<h3>Abstract</h3> Approximately 20-25% of the population worldwide is affected by superficial cutaneous mycoses (SCM). SCM are cutaneous fungal infections with a wide array of systemic and topical treatment options. However, successful therapeutic outcomes are limited by patient non-adherence, medication side effects, potential drug interactions, antifungal resistance and disease recurrence. Advances in formulation technology have allowed for the development of more effective and safer therapies. In this article we will review several new and emerging pharmacotherapeutics for onychomycosis and tinea pedis.'
