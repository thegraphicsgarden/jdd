	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>Approximately 20-25% of the population worldwide is affected by superficial cutaneous mycoses (SCM). SCM are cutaneous fungal infections with a wide array of systemic and topical treatment options. However, successful therapeutic outcomes are limited by patient non-adherence, medication side effects, potential drug interactions, antifungal resistance and disease recurrence. Advances in formulation technology have allowed for the development of more effective and safer therapies. In this article we will review several new and emerging pharmacotherapeutics for onychomycosis and tinea pedis.</p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Superficial cutaneous mycoses (SCM) are frequently encountered skin infections affecting 20-25% of the population worldwide.<sup>1</sup> SCM are typically categorized by the location of fungal infection and further subdivided by its causative dermatophyte. Current therapies include an array of systemic and topical agents. Successful therapeutic outcomes are limited by patient non-adherence, medication side effects, potential drug interactions, antifungal resistance and disease recurrence. In the following, we will review several new and emerging pharmacotherapeutics for onychomycosis and tinea pedis.</p>

	<h3>Onychomycosis</h3>

	<p>Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit (eg, nail plate, nail bed, and periungal tissue). Dermatophytes, yeasts, and nondermatophyte molds are common etiologic agents. Four onychomycosis variants exist: distal subungual onychomycosis, white superficial onychomycosis, proximal subungual onychomycosis, and candida onychomycosis. The dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum is responsible for up to 90% of infections, followed by Trichophyton mentagrophytes.2 Less common pathogenic organisms include other dermatophytes, eg, Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum canis, and Epidermophyton Floccosum; yeasts, eg, Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis; and molds, eg, Acremonium spp, Fusarium spp, Aspergillus, and Scytalidium spp.<sup>1</sup></p>

	<p>Approximately 10-12% of the US population3<sup>3</sup> suffers from onychomycosis and its incidence increases with advanced age. While most patients are asymptomatic, those who seek medical attention suffer from pain, paronychia, and interference with normal function.4</p>

	<p>Several therapeutic options exist for onychomycosis, however it continues to be a challenge to clear and maintain. The primary endpoint in clinical trials evaluating onychomycosis treatment is the “complete cure,” defined as a negative fungal culture and potassium hydroxide (KOH) prep, as well as restoring the normal appearance of the nail. “Mycologic cure,” on the other hand, refers to onychomycotic nails, which are not 100% anatomically clear, but yield a negative fungal culture. Current systemic therapies include fluconazole, itraconazole, and terbinafine, while topically ciclopirox nail lacquer may be used.<sup>5</sup></p>

	<h3>New Therapies for Onychomycosis</h3>

	<p>Itraconazole 200 mg single daily dose received FDA approval in April 2010 for the treatment of onychomycosis caused by T. rubrum or T. mentagrophytes in non-immunocompromised patients. Itraconazole is an azole antifungal agent with antifungal activity through cytochrome P450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol resulting in the disruption of fungal cell membrane and associated enzyme systems. The efficacy of the 200 mg single daily dose of itraconazole is comparable to two 100 mg itraconazole QD6 (Table 1).</p>

	<p>A 51-year-old Hispanic woman with stage IV metastatic melanoma involving the lungs, liver, spleen, bilateral kidneys, pancreas, iliac bone, lymph nodes, mediastinum, and left anterior neck presented to our dermatology clinic after one month of daily vemurafenib therapy. She had previously received interferon and biochemotherapy and had no history of non-melanoma skin cancers. Her head-to-toe skin examination prior to initiating vemurafenib revealed no suspicious lesions. At day 18, her primary team noted her to have keratotic lesions on her left arm, face, scalp, and posterior neck. She reported that she noticed these lesions developing within one week of beginning vemurafenib treatment.</p>

	<p>At our initial examination one month into therapy she had evidence of significant photodamage, mild keratoderma on the heels, and approximately 167 hyperkeratotic papules diffusely on the face, neck, chest, back, and extremities. Six lesions concerning for non-melanoma skin cancers were biopsied. Pathology demonstrated a squamous cell carcinoma with keratoacanthoma features on the right upper cutaneous lip, two verrucae on the right lateral and left posterior neck, and three keratinocytic proliferations with features of verruca and actinic keratosis on the left dorsal wrist and right knee, and verruca with cytologic atypia on the right nasal sidewall. The squamous cell carcinoma was treated with Mohs micrographic surgery.</p>

	<p>At the one-month dermatology follow-up visit (two months into vemurafenib therapy), approximately 100 lesions were observed. Ten lesions concerning for non-melanoma skin cancer were biopsied; 47 hyperkeratotic papules were treated with cryotherapy, and the remaining lesions were hyperkeratotic papules, suspected verrucae, which were not treated at this time. Pathology demonstrated four squamous cell carcinomas on the bilateral arms, one keratoacanthoma on the left lower leg, and the remaining five were actinic keratoses and verrucae on the legs and back. The skin cancers were treated surgically.</p>

	<p>Vemurafenib is a BRAF kinase inhibitor that improves the survival of patients with metastatic melanoma with the V600E BRAF mutation. Vemurafenib received FDA approval in August 2011 for this use.1 The response of melanoma is rapid, but the development of numerous squamous cell carcinomas may limit the use of vemurafenib.</p>

	<p>Dermatologists are often challenged by the management of these fast developing, or almost eruptive, BRAF-associated neoplasms. At our institution we conduct monthly total body skin examinations and utilize cryotherapy to treat the smaller, benign hyperkeratotic lesions that do not clinically necessitate biopsy to evaluate for skin cancer. In patients with numerous lesions, repeated cryotherapy, biopsies, and surgeries can cause significant discomfort, disfigurement, increased risk of infection, and a tremendous burden to the patient.</p>
