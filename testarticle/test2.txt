<p class="articles-case-articles-bodyfirst" style="text-align:justify;">Cosmeceuticals” are topical products that provide enhanced skincare benefit which go beyond traditional cosmetics known primarily for covering, moisturizing and cleansing the skin. Cosmeceuticals do not have the same regulatory requirements as prescription skincare products and generally lack rigorous clinical trials to substantiate efficacy, potency, or consistency. Cosmeceuticals for skin rejuvenation are now the fastest growing segment of the multibillion-dollar skin care market. Increasingly, cosmeceuticals are being used in professional practices as adjuncts to in-office procedures and prescription drugs as well as stand-alone home treatments.</p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
Patients frequently seek advice from skin care professionals. More scientific studies are being performed on nonprescription topical skincare products and this provides clinicians with more evidence by which to recommend skincare products.</p>


	<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">The subject matter can be confusing for both the patient as well as the provider. For the patient, the market offers products that claim the same aesthetic benefits from different combinations of ingredients at discount (low) or premium (high) prices. For the provider, many have had limited formal education on the topic. Consequently, it can be difficult to sort through the large number of products available to identify those with scientific data to support their efficacy. Of practical concern, discussing and recommending topical skincare products with patients in the midst of a busy clinic can be time consuming. In addition, physicians who are not yet confident in their knowledge of skincare product alternatives may feel awkward when patients ask for recommendations. As a result, many physicians avoid actively discussing cosmeceuticals with patients. This leaves the patient without informed recommendations from their trusted clinician, and uneducated as to how skincare programs may fit into their overall skin health practices.</p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">Skin care professionals are the trusted experts that need to guide patients toward understanding basic skin biology and choosing optimally effective skin care products based on quality clinical studies that demonstrate safety and efficacy for the desired skincare benefit.</p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
The concept of a tool to provide basic skincare product education for patients and help busy professionals guide their patients toward choosing an effective skin care program was first developed by Kenner in 2010 as the Topical Nutritional Pyramid<sup>TM</sup>.<sup>1</sup> Over the years, this clinical tool has undergone extensive review as well as practical implementation. The Skin Health and Beauty Pyramid<sup>TM</sup> was created from an extensive review by thought leaders in the field of aesthetic medicine. This tool is intended for use by the novice as well as the seasoned aesthetic provider to allow patients a fundamental understanding of the ongoing need for photo-protection, as well as the multipronged approach needed to repair cellular damage that is ongoing in a continual process.</p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
The goals of the Skin Health and Beauty Pyramid<sup>TM</sup> for the patient are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Educate on the deleterious effects of photoaging on skin health.</li>
<li>Provide a hierarchical ordering of key cosmeceutical categories with regard to beneficial impact on the skin, so that appropriate usage choices can be made.</li>
<li>Serve as a reference to help patients supplement or scale back on their skincare regimen as needed, without compromising essential skin care.</li>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">The Skin Health & Beauty Pyramid provides physicians, clinicians and patients with a “roadmap”, a clinically based solution to the challenge of attaining optimal skin health and beauty, intended to improve professional and patient education, simplify product selection and improve clinical outcome. The Skin Health and Beauty Pyramid ingredient and technology inclusion criteria must be supported by credible clinical studies and physician experience. This Pyramid can narrow your search for effective topical skincare products.</p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">The Skin Health & Beauty Pyramid is based on three hierarchal components, arranged in ascending order of priority from bottom to top. The base of the pyramid defines the ‘must have daily’ fundamental skin protection and repair ingredients and functions that should be the foundation of all skincare regimens. The middle or core of the pyramid defines the ingredients and functions that a patient ‘needs to have’ to help transform, normalize and rejuvenate skin. The top of the pyramid defines the ‘nice to have’ ingredients and functions that provide cell stimulation. These are the newer, promising technologies that can help reduce the visible signs of aging and optimize skin health and beauty.</p>

<h3>Base of the Pyramid: Fundamental</h3>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
Every person concerned about improving skin health and beauty must be committed to a lifelong lifestyle that includes daily protection and repair against sun and environmental exposure, otherwise every step we take to improve our skin health and appearance is undermined on a continual basis by damage accumulation from environmental exposure. The process of environmental skin damage and the necessary protection and repair roles that SPF, antioxidants and DNA Repair Enzymes play is shown in the Skin Protection and Repair Diagram (Figure 2). The environmental insults to the skin are depicted on the right side of the diagram – predominantly solar radiation but also smoke, air pollution and ozone. The bolded dotted line represents sunscreen protection and depicts the relative amount of protection for each insult. For example, the majority of UV-B radiation is blocked by most high SPF sunscreens, but the level of UV-A radiation blocked is less and no infrared radiation is blocked by topical sunscreens. In addition sunscreens do not block other forms of environmental oxidative stress such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, ozone and even oxygen itself. Environmental exposure that is not blocked by sunscreen creates toxic free radicals, depicted by blue dots in starbursts in the diagram. Toxic free radicals are scavenged by antioxidants, represented in the diagram by the second defense shield, represented by the “Pac-Man” images neutralizing the free radicals before they can cause damage to DNA and cellular structures. However, antioxidants do not scavenge all toxic free radicals, so some toxic free radicals damage DNA and cellular structures. DNA that is damaged by free radicals and direct absorption of UV photons of energy is repaired naturally by the body’s own natural repair mechanisms including DNA repair enzymes. The body’s natural DNA repair mechanisms are indicated in the diagram by the protein enzymes (“green molecules”) intercepting the lesions that distort the helix and repairing them to their normal healthy state – depicted on the far left by an undamaged DNA strand. The two most common forms of DNA damage that lead to cell mutation and skin cancer are shown in the diagram: cyclobutane pyrimidime dimers (CPDs) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 OHdG) lesions. The diagram stresses the need for all three types of protection and repair to minimize DNA damage and maximize skin health.</p>

<h3>Sunscreen</h3>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
Traditionally, topical skin protection has been viewed as synonymous with sun protection for the general public, SPF alone is perceived to be the gold standard for skin protection. It has only been in the last two decades that scientists have focused on the deficiencies of SPF, such as the archaic method of determination based on UV-B radiation. The FDA did not incorporate UV-A protection into the sunscreen OTC monograph with the new critical wavelength “Broad Spectrum” test until July, 2012.<sup>2</sup> The EU standards for the same were recommended in 2006. <sup>3</sup></p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
Skin health benefits of sunscreen include reducing the risk of sunburn from UVB- and reducing the risk of accumulated sun damage that can cause pre-cancerous lesions and skin cancer. Skin beauty benefits of sunscreen include reducing the visible signs of aging caused by UV-B and UV-A radiation such as fine lines and wrinkles, dull skin, skin laxity, and undesired pigmentation.</p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">Topical skin protection as measured by SPF, even with a UV-A component, falls short in the total picture of skin protection. Sunscreens agents themselves, whether chemical or physical, simply cannot provide total environmental protection by the nature of their mechanism of action. Sunscreen ingredients function by scattering, reflecting, blocking or absorbing UV radiation before toxic free radicals are formed in the skin. Sunscreen agents are not 100% efficient. Sunscreen alone is not enough because:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li type="disc">Sunscreens are not 100% effective at blocking UV radiation. SPF 45 blocks 98%<sup>3</sup> of UVB and less UVA radiation.<sup>4,5,6,7</sup></li>

<li type="disc">Most people apply only 25-50% of the recommended amount of sunscreen.<sup>7</sup></li>

<li type="disc">Slightly more than half of the energy from the Sun arrives on Earth in the form of Infrared radiation Sunscreen does not block Infrared radiation which penetrates the skin deeper than UV-B and UV-A, and causes free radical formation and accelerated skin aging.<sup>8</sup></li>

<li type="disc">Sunscreens are not antioxidants and do not scavenge or neutralize toxic free radicals generated from other forms of environmental oxidative stress including those free radicals induced by cigarette smoke, ozone or air pollution.</li>

<div class="story">
<h3>Antioxidants</h3>
<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
In 2005, Lewis, Dinardo, Maibach et al, introduced the concept
of topical antioxidant protection based on the cumulative
oxidative stress protection capacity score of an antioxidant
from multiple tests (or assays).<sup>9</sup> This concept of skin protection
was established on the entirely different mode of action
of an antioxidant as opposed to a sunscreen agent. Antioxidants
inhibit environmental oxidative stress by scavenging
toxic free radicals. Antioxidants therefore act as a “back stop”
to scavenge toxic free radicals formed by the inefficient ability
of sunscreens to block all UV radiation or to block any IR radiation,
pollution, ozone, and cigarette smoke.</p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">Antioxidants provide skin health benefits by reducing DNA
and cellular structure damage.<sup>10</sup> Antioxidants, dependent on
type and concentration, provide multiple skin beauty benefits
including promotion of new collagen growth, reduction in the
appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improved skin radiance,
reduction in unwanted pigmentation, and an anti-inflammatory
effect to reduce skin redness. Dr. Fitzpatrick found that
use of a Vitamin C formulation demonstrated a “clinically
visible and statistically significant improvement in wrinkling
when used topically for 12 weeks. This clinical improvement
correlates with biopsy evidence of new collagen formation.”
<sup>11</sup> The antioxidant, hydroquinone, is the current gold standard
for treating melasma and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
<sup>12</sup> Antioxidants provide anti-inflammatory properties and
reduce redness as shown by Dr. McDaniel using antioxidants
found in the whole coffee cherry fruit - Coffeeberry<sup>®</sup>.<sup>13</sup> In addition,
antioxidants can protect proteins from glycation or
carbonylation, which could result in the preservation of collagen,
elastin and other proteins.<sup>14,15,16</sup></p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">Antioxidants do not inhibit direct absorption of photons of
UV energy on the DNA strand and antioxidants alone are not
powerful enough to scavenge or neutralize all free radicals
formed as a result of inefficient SPF protection so damage
to DNA and cellular structures is not completely abated.
Neither sunscreens nor antioxidants repair damaged DNA.
Sunscreens and antioxidants are not enough.</p>

<h3>DNA Repair Enzymes</h3>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
New scientific advances have clearly demonstrated that
DNA Repair Enzymes play a critical and final step in cell protection
against oxidative stress as a result of UV exposure,
other environmental sources of toxic free radicals or even
endogenous Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production.
DNA repair enzymes enhance the body’s natural DNA repair
process. DNA damage can be quantified by measuring
the most common UV induced DNA lesions: cyclobutane
pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and guanine oxidation (8OHdG).<sup>17</sup>
The accumulation of DNA lesions (CPD and 8OHdG) can
cause cell death, cell mutation and skin cancer.<sup>17</sup> In 2001, Dr.Yarosh reported reduced incidence of basal cell carcinoma
by 30% and reduced actinic keratoses by 68%, compared
with placebo in xeroderma pigmentosum patients using
a topical applied endonuclease DNA repair enzyme for 1
year.<sup>18</sup> In 2010, Dr. Moy reported a 45% reduction in actinic
keratosis after 48 weeks using topical application of an endonuclease
DNA Repair Enzyme. <sup>19</sup> In 2012, Dr. Berardesca
demonstrated a 93% reduction in CPD lesions with SPF
50 and one photolyase DNA repair enzyme.<sup>20</sup> In 2013, Dr.
Spencer reported a 53% reduction in CPD lesions and a 37%
reduction in mutant p53 after 12 weeks use of topically applied
SPF 29 plus three DNA repair enzymes: photolyase,
endonuclease and 8oxoG glycosylase. Dr. Spencer also
showed early indication that DNA repair enzymes reduced
solar elastosis in the dermis, which could prevent visible
signs of unwanted pigmentation.<sup>21</sup> In addition, DNA repair
enzymes have been shown to reduce telomere shortening.
Dr. Emanuele used SPF 50 and two DNA repair enzymes
resulting in 97% reduction in telomere shortening and 92%
reduction in C-FOS expression.<sup>22</sup></p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
The use of antioxidants and DNA repair enzymes in topical
skin protection and repair does not diminish the importance
of SPF. Clearly UV radiation is the overwhelming source of
oxidative stress in our environment and there is no antioxidant
or DNA Repair Enzyme capable of combatting this
stress without powerful SPF as a first line of defense. The
ultimate purpose of any topical skin protection product
should be prevention of DNA damage and preservation of
DNA health and vitality. In a recent 60 subject clinical trial,
the individual and cumulative contribution effect of SPF, antioxidants
and DNA Repair Enzymes in the prevention of
DNA lesions was demonstrated<sup>17</sup>; this protection effect was
progressive (additive in one case, multiplicative in others).
The diagram illustrates that each of these components contribute
towards overall protection, the most protection and
repair being provided by a combination of all three critical
skin protection components.</p>

<h3>Middle of the Pyramid: Transform</h3>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
Photodamaged skin biopsies show all of the typical cellular
structural changes characteristic of accumulated UV damage<sup>23</sup>
(Figure 3, far left illustration):</p>

<li type="disc">Irregular thickened stratum corneum</li>

<li type="disc">Results of decreased glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)</li>

<li type="disc">Collapsed fibroblasts, reduced and fragmented collagen
and elastin</li>

<li type="disc">Reduced basal cell division</li>
</ul>

<div class="story">

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
These underlying structural changes manifest as changes
in the skin’s appearance, including sallow complexion, increased
fine lines and wrinkles, irregular increased skin
pigmentation, skin sagging and an overall loss of skin luster,
radiance and beauty and moisture retention.</p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
Retinoids (Vitamin A and its derivatives) and Alpha Hydroxy
Acids (AHAs) have both been shown to effectively improve
these skin changes. Both ingredients, launched in the 1980’s,
have stood the test of time, undergone numerous clinical trials,
and have been proven to be safe and effective ingredients
used by physicians to treat a range of common skin conditions.
Although these two ingredients have entirely different
mechanisms of action, the resulting visible skin benefits are
cumulative and overlapping in appearance.</p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
AHAs, particularly lactic and glycolic acid, have two primary
normalizing modes of action: skin moisturization and exfoliation.
<sup>24</sup> Although many other ingredients are touted as skin
moisturizers, AHAs are unique in the mechanism of action
in achieving the final result. AHAs are true skin moisturizing
agents, unlike typical moisturizers that are simple oil and
water emulsions. These typical moisturizers provide an occlusive
skin barrier after application and function to decrease
transepidermal water loss and thereby increase skin moisturization.
R. Stern et al mapped a mechanism of action for
AHA skin moisturization and clinically demonstrated that it is
based on increased Hyaluronic Acid (HA) deposition in both
epidermis and dermis post AHA application.<sup>25</sup> HA, a high molecular
weight nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan, is capable of
binding thousands of times its molecular weight in water and
is the principal component of the Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM)
responsible for moisture retention in the dermis and epidermis.
Further, it is now known that lactic acid, the bodies’
natural cell signal AHA, has a specific glycoprotein binding
site on the fibroblast that induces this activity. Increasing
skin moisture retention means increasing epidermal and
dermal volume, which reduces fine lines and wrinkles and
increases radiance. Dr. Van Scott concludes that with AHAs
“epidermal and dermal hyaluronic acid and collagen gene
expression were all increased in glycolic acid-treated skin as
compared to vehicle-treated controls”.<sup>26</sup></p>


<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
In addition, AHAs are skin exfoliating agents, decreasing corneocyte
cohesion at the lower levels of the stratum corneum,
a mechanism of action documented by Van Scott and Yu in the
1980s.<sup>27</sup> As skin ages, the dead cell exfoliation rate slows. As
dead cells build up on the outer skin surface, they take an irregular
disorderly pattern. This irregular skin surface reflects and
refracts light that produces dull, sallow complexion. The effect
of AHA leads to renewed skin exfoliation and the irregular stratum
corneum is cast away allowing for a new dead cell layer
to be laid down in an orderly fashion – the brick and mortar model. This renewed stratum corneum is smoother and reflects
and refracts light to give skin a radiant, youthful glow. pH is the
determining factor in AHA skin tolerability; if properly formulated,
AHA products can be used without skin irritation.<sup>28,29,30,31</sup></p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
These two unique mechanisms of action – moisturization and
exfoliation- create visible benefits and explain the popularity of
AHAs as skin conditioning agents over the past three decades.
As illustrated in the diagram, the effects can be seen in the center
illustration:</p>

<ul style="margin-left:20px;">
<li type="disc">The stratum corneum is thinner, more compact and
smoother, reflecting and refracting light to give skin a radiant
youthful glow.</li>

<li type="disc">The epidermis is thicker due to increased moisture retention
(increased epidermal volume) as a result of increased
HA deposition thereby diminishing the appearance of fine
lines and wrinkles.</li>

<li type="disc">Irregular skin pigmentation is reduced by bringing
transient melanin content to the surface, followed by subsequent
exfoliation.</li>

<li type="disc">Fibroblasts are activated into a more normalized state. Fibroblasts
are the skin’s “factory” producing many of the
essential skin molecules required by the ECM - collagen,
elastin, GAGs, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
The far right illustration (Figure 3) shows the benefits of AHAs
and Retinoids together. Retinoids, Vitamin A and its derivatives,
are known for their ability to increase cellular mitosis,
jump start cellular metabolism and increase key molecular
synthesis of compounds such as collagen. Additionally, topical
application of retinoids provide improvement with respect
to several histological parameters, such as thickening of
the epidermis, an increase in the height of rete ridges and
the number of dermal papillae, a gradual displacement of
age-related deposition of dermal elastin by collagen and peptidoaminoglycans,
normalization of melanocyte function, and
an increase in the number of dermal fibroblasts as seen in the
final illustration of the combined effect of AHAs and retinoids
on the skin.<sup>32,33,34,35</sup> Dr. Kang concludes that topical Tretinoin
improves and repairs “the epidermis (dyspigmentation and
surface roughness), and as the evidence will show, dermal
(fine wrinkles) components of photoaging”.<sup>36</sup></p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
To this date, after nearly 30 years since their introduction in
dermatology, there have been no technologies with greater
impact for skin health and beauty than the combination of
AHAs and Retinoids; hence the patient or consumer looking
for transformation of photodamaged skin needs these two
technologies in their daily skincare regimen.</p>

<h3>Top of the Pyramid: Optimize</h3>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
The Cell Stimulation Diagram (Figure 4) illustrates two cell signal
pathways used by peptides and growth factors. The human body
is a protein machine relying on roughly 100,000 different types of
proteins, interacting and reciprocating, much like the interaction
of the gears in a watch, to carry out every function of the human
body such as respiration, digestion, and muscle contraction. Machines
wear out, proteins wear out; when proteins wear out or
break down they produce protein fragments or smaller linkages
of amino acids known as peptides. These peptides can then act as
cell signal agents to call the cell to action to make new proteins.
Everything the cell does is based on protein-protein interaction;
receptor proteins in the cell membrane receive messages
from the ECM or the cytoplasm by way of molecules that have a
unique “fit” like a puzzle piece with the receptor protein that in
turn has a unique fit with an effector protein that in turn fits with other proteins that deliver a signal to the cellular DNA– a call to
action to transcribe a portion of the DNA strand (a gene) to make
something– for example a new collagen protein as shown in the illustration
following the yellow pathway. Cosmeceutical peptides
are newer technologies and “hold the promise to modulate much
of the functioning of the skin, but the details remain perplexing”.<sup>37</sup>
Similarly, growth factors are proteins or polypeptides, which
have unique receptor sites that also call the cell to action and
play a key role in the regulation of cell division and tissue proliferation.
As shown in the red pathway in the illustration, the
binding of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) to the cell membrane
receptor protein leads to cell division.</p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
There is a lot of discussion in the marketplace about stem cells
because these cells are factories for production of cell signaling
peptides and growth factors so they are often cultured in

the lab to obtain the “broth” they live in that is rich in peptides
and growth factors. Stem cells themselves are not “living” in a
cosmetic formulation but this is often the consumer perception
based on erroneous marketing hype.</p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body" style="text-align:justify;">
Dr. Fitzpatrick, testing a topical skincare formulation containing
physiologically balanced, naturally secreted and stabilized
growth factor blend concluded that a “total of 78.6% of patients
with photodamaged skin showed clinical improvement at 60
days. New collagen formation increased by 37%, and epidermal
thickening increased by 27%”.<sup>38</sup></p>

With thousands of skin care products to choose from, clinicians
and patients can find it hard to distinguish between marketing
hype and reliable information. Patients and consumers rely on
physicians for guidance on which products are best for them and
their respective budgets. Many skincare brands are based upon
a single super ingredient or so-called a ‘hero’ product. The Skin
Health and Beauty Pyramid is a skincare philosophy based on
years of clinical evidence and real-world testing. The pyramid
shows the highest priority and most fundamental skincare ingredients
and functions in the base. Skincare regimens can be
effective, simple and affordable when patients use products
that address all of the ‘must have daily’ base and ‘need to have’
middle of the pyramid. After the base and middle of the pyramid
are fulfilled, then patients can add the “nice to have” top of the
