<p class="articles-case-article-body">
While part of its name,<i> vulgaris</i>, reflects the very fact that it
is common, acne vulgaris is much less common in babies, toddlers,
or preadolescents. In most individuals at a variety of
ages acne vulgaris is not subtle, and a preteen or teen presenting
with comedones, pustules, and inflammatory papules
on his or her face is considered to have acne until proven otherwise.
There is a good understanding of the basic pathophysiology
of acne, and multiple algorithms have been
developed to help assist practitioners in composing successful
treatment regimens. The pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and
cosmeceutical industries have recognized acne as an important
consumer concern, supporting the development of a
myriad of treatment products from which to choose a therapeutic
strategy for individual patients.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
However, especially when presenting in infancy and childhood,
acne may not be straightforward and can be of great
consequence. It may cause serious sequelae including severe
scarring and emotional distress<sup>1,2</sup> (in both the child and parents),
and its treatment has fueled concerns about contributing
to the public health threat of increased antibacterial
resistance.<sup>3</sup> It can present much earlier than expected, and it
can resemble a number of other inflammatory and noninflammatory
dermatoses (Figure 1).<sup>4</sup> The myths and conjectures
that circulate regarding cause and exacerbators of acne
have been a source of consternation for patients, families, and
practitioners alike.<sup>5</sup> The young pediatric acne patient shows
that some of our knowledge regarding pathogenesis is limited.
Similarly, treating acne is not always as easy as mail order
companies make it seem with 3-step products. Conscientious
healthcare providers run into the daily problem of choosing
acne weapons that are highly effective with the least amount
of collateral ill effects.</p>
<h3> Epidemiology</h3>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Acne vulgaris is near universal in adolescents and young
adults in the western world, with an incidence of greater than
80% in people aged 11 to 30 years.<sup>6</sup> It has been estimated that
newborns are affected with up to 20% prevalence in the first
few weeks of life, though it is uncertain if the reported eruptions
eruptions
are all true acne.<sup>7</sup> The next and much less commonly
affected population is infants, generally between 6 and 16
months of age.<sup>8</sup> Mid-childhood acne, seen in those children
between 1 and 7 years of age, is rare though few scattered
comedones are occasionally observed in this age group.<sup>9,10</sup>
The incidence of acne vulgaris rises in the next subset of patients
with prepubertal acne, which can have age of onset
around 8 years old.<sup>11</sup></p>

<div class="story">
<h3>Neonatal Acne</h3>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Neonates can present with true comedones,<sup>12</sup> some of which
may progress to significant inflammatory and even scarring
cystic acne within the first year of life. They can also present
with superficial pustules (ie, without comedones or acneiform
inflammatory papules and pustules). This observation was
made popular in the late 1990s by a series of papers that introduced
the term “neonatal cephalic pustulosis (NCP).”
The term describes a transient erythematous papulopustular
eruption in the first weeks of life, which is localized to the
cheeks, chin, forehead, and eyelids and less commonly to the
neck, upper chest, and scalp.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Unlike older acne patients where <em>Propionibacterium acnes</em> (P.
acnes) clearly plays a crucial pathogenic role, <em>Malassezia</em>
species (M. <em>sympodalis</em> and M. <em>globosa</em>), a normal flora of infant
skin, has been suspected of being a causative agent in
NCP based on the presence of <em>Malassezia</em> in smears taken
from pustules of affected infants, and recovery on lesional
swab cultures.<sup>13,14</sup> One follow-up study, however, showed
that 38% of infants diagnosed with NCP had smears that
were negative for <em>Malassezia.</em><sup>15</sup> Semantic confusion—centered
around 1) the implication that neonates are incapable
of presenting with true early-onset acne and 2) the fact that
other pustular eruptions may present similarly to <em>Malassezia</em>-associated
NCP—has historically been the result.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
NCP may represent the inflammatory result of an overgrowth
of lipophilic species acquired postnatally. Maternal influences
impacting both NCP and early-onset acne include
hormonal stimulation and activity of the sebaceous glands.<sup>16
</sup>Interestingly, maternal and infant perinatal sebum excretion
rates are significantly correlated; it is unknown if maternal
hormonal activity prenatally impacts on future risk of
pubertal acne or seborrhea.<sup>17</sup> It is likely that both NCP and
true early-presenting acne in neonates are due to multiple
factors and future studies would be useful.<sup>12</sup></p>

<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Aggressive treatment of NCP is usually not necessary and is
probably contraindicated as the majority of cases tend to resolve
spontaneously and without scarring by 4 months of
age.<sup>18</sup> It has been stated in the literature that topical ketoconazole
cream can help shorten the duration of the lesions,
<sup>14</sup> but this remains to be further investigated in a
rigorous manner. A mild topical retinoid may help those patients
with true comedones. Referral to a pediatric dermatologist
is recommended if lesions persist.</p>
<h3>Infantile Acne</h3>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Infantile acne affects boys more than girls but is infrequent
in both sexes. Clinically, a combination of open and closed
comedones, inflammatory papules, and pustules may be seen.
The cheeks are the most common sites of involvement,
though the chin, forehead, and back may also be involved.<sup>19
</sup>Cystic lesions, draining sinuses, and deep communicating
nodules with their potential for scarring may rarely be present.
<sup>20</sup> In contrast to neonatal acne, infantile acne can persist
until age 4 or 5, sometimes remaining active until puberty.<sup>7</sup>
A family history of acne may occasionally be reported.<sup>19</sup> Parents Parents
should be counseled that severe cases of infantile acne,
especially conglobate forms, may be a marker for severe
forms in adolescence.<sup>21</sup></p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
While the pathogenesis of infantile acne has yet to be fully
elucidated, it may be related to a combination of hormonal
factors. All infants, regardless of gender, are subjected to increased
levels of androgens secondary to an enlarged zona
reticularis in the neonatal adrenal gland. This zone produces
high levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate (DHEAS), which in turn stimulate
sebaceous glands.<sup>22</sup> A few months after birth, however,
production of DHEA and DHEAS virtually ceases, only to
resume some 6 years later.<sup>23</sup> Sebum excretion rates seem to
coincide with this temporal rise and fall.<sup>24</sup></p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Testicular androgen production may also play a role.<sup>21</sup> Testosterone
levels in girls normally decrease from birth to 2 weeks.
In contrast, boys experience increasing levels of luteinizing
hormone and, consequently, testosterone until around 6 to
12 months of age.<sup>25</sup> By one year of age, however, testicular androgen
production diminishes markedly, remaining low until
puberty when circulating testosterone levels increase more
than 20-fold. This difference in testosterone levels during this
first year of life and the subsequent effect on sebaceous gland
stimulation may help account for the increased prevalence of
infantile acne in boys versus girls.<sup>22</sup></p>
<h3>Early Childhood (Postinfantile) Acne</h3>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Clinically, acne presenting in midchildhood can appear as a
combination of open and closed comedones, inflammatory
papules, and pustules. Because androgen production by the
neonatal adrenal is minimal after one year of age (not becoming
more active until usually around 6 to 8 years of age)
the occurrence of acne within this age bracket should raise
concerns for possible hyperandrogenism.<sup>26</sup> Management is
similar to therapy of acne at any age.</p>
<h3>Prepubertal Acne</h3>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Acne may be the first sign of pubertal maturation and appears
to correlate more with pubertal development than age. Onset
of lesions, usually comedones, may precede pubic hair and
areolar development in young girls<sup>27</sup> and pubic hair development
and testicular enlargement in boys.<sup>28</sup> Acne in this age
group is typically midfacial, generally affecting the forehead,
nose, and chin. Children who develop more comedones at
this age appear more prone to severe acne in adolescence.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
The onset of adrenarche has a genetic predisposition and
presents with high levels of DHEA and DHEAS that start rising
at around 6 to 7 years of age in girls and around 7 to 8
years of age in boys.<sup>25,29,30</sup> Acne typically occurs during this
time when increased DHEAS production by the adrenal
cortex stimulates sebum production in both sexes.<sup>31</sup> Previous
studies have shown that girls who develop severe comedonal
acne have higher levels of DHEAS compared with girls with
mild comedonal acne or no acne. The biggest difference between
these groups occurs 2 years prior to menarche.<sup>11</sup> This
suggests that high levels of DHEAS at an earlier develop-</p>
<p style="margin: 30px 0px 10px;"><a href="#jddonline-article"><strong>&uarr; back to top</strong></a></p>

<div class="story">
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
mental stage may be associated with earlier onset of sebum
production. A recent study supports this hypothesis, demonstrating
that increases in sebum production and <em>P. acnes</em> colonization
occur in parallel in children with acne from the age
of 8 years.<sup>32</sup> Prospectively, it was observed that <em>P. acnes</em> colonization
rates in the nares correlated with age, while skin
colonization correlated with pubertal status and presence or
absence of acne. Acne prone children seem to secrete sebum
earlier than children without acne, and this may allow for
earlier colonization of  <em>P. acnes</em>.</p>

<h3>When to Consider Further Work-Up</h3>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Perhaps most worrisome to clinicians is the concern that
early acne may be a manifestation of an underlying condition
like congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in neonates or
precocious puberty in infants and children. While routine endocrinologic
evaluation is not indicated for the majority of
patients with acne,<sup>33</sup> it is important to consider in all young
acne patients, especially in those rare patients that present
with mid-childhood acne.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
A careful history and physical including blood pressure
should be taken, paying particular attention to growth and
development and additional signs of androgen excess. In
young children, this may be manifested by accelerated
growth, advanced bone age, body odor, pubic or axillary
hair, and genital maturation. After puberty, common signs
and symptoms of virilization include polycystic ovaries, infrequent
menses, hirsutism, male or female pattern alopecia,
infertility, acanthosis nigricans, and truncal obesity.<sup>34</sup></p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Useful screening labs include DHEA), DHEAS, folliclestimulating
hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin,
17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and free testosterone (total
testosterone may be used if free testosterone is not available).
Bone age, a good physiologic measurement of androgenicity,
provides an excellent screening examination.<sup>9</sup> Immediate referral
to a pediatric endocrinologist is recommended for any
abnormality or recalcitrant acne cases.</p>
<h3>Management</h3>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
The therapeutic approach to pediatric acne should be guided
by several main principles: 1) target as many age-appropriate
pathogenic factors as possible; 2) use the least aggressive
regimen that provides sustained resolution; 3) avoid bacterial
resistance; and 4) anticipate treatment-specific side effects
in order to maximize patient compliance/adherence.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
From a behavioral perspective, it must be understood that
some children may be quite unlike the self-conscious adolescent
and may not be concerned with treating their acne.
In the case of early, mild comedonal acne without a significant
inflammatory component, minimal intervention is reasonable
with acknowledgement that the primary carers (ie,
“who cares about,” as well as “who cares for”) of the acne may
be the parents. Education should be provided regarding the
avoidance of aggressive facial scrubbing and the utility of gentle
cleansing. Manipulation of lesions (“zit popping”) should
be avoided. A discussion of pathogenesis is reasonable, dispelling
myths that are often observed to cause tension between
the parents and child/adolescent, such as the parental
certainty that the acne lesions are caused by pizza, chocolate,
and other dietary indiscretions. Finally, caregivers should be
counseled regarding the need for patience with therapeutic
interventions. The general schema for treatment of pediatric
acne does not differ from that of older adolescents and adults.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Topical retinoids remain the foundation for treatment for
both comedonal and inflammatory acne because they act to
reduce obstruction within the follicle and have direct antiinflammatory
properties.<sup>35,36</sup> For maximal results, topical
retinoids should not be used as “spot treatment.” Instead, they
should be applied to the entire affected area using no more
of the medication than is necessary for efficacy, usually a peasized
amount divided evenly over the entire surface of the
face. Importantly, no consensus has yet to be reached regarding
the relative efficacy and comparative tolerance of
currently available topical retinoids.<sup>33</sup></p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Irritation is a common side effect of retinoids that can usually
be managed with some common sense solutions. The
treating physician should be aware of cleansing regimens
and the use of over-the-counter medications such as salicylic
acid or astringents. In younger patients, a “step-up” dosing
schedule may be very useful (twice weekly for 2 weeks; thrice
weekly for 3 weeks, etc.) in order to ease into more frequent
dosing. Selecting the proper vehicle can also help.<sup>37</sup> A noncomedogenic
and hypoallergenic daily moisturizer with builtin
sun protection factor (SPF) assists in treating dryness,
irritation, and sun sensitization.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Benzoyl peroxide is a potent antimicrobial with rapid bactericidal
action. It relies on the generation of free radicals as the
basis of its antimicrobial activity, and it is available in a variety
of concentrations and vehicles with proven efficacy in
the treatment of acne.<sup>38</sup> Microorganisms (eg,  <em>P. acnes</em> ) seem
unable to develop resistance to benzoyl peroxide<sup>39</sup> and for this
reason it is often used in combination with oral or topical antibiotics,
as well as in addition to retinoids. For pediatric patients,
it is traditionally considered a first-line treatment, and
its long history of efficacy and safety make it suitable as an
alternative to retinoids as monotherapy for the treatment of
mild acne.<sup>40</sup> Over-the-counter wash formulations are particularly
appealing because they allow patients to apply benzoyl
peroxide in the shower or bathtub and then wash off the
medication. This provides short contact and decreases the
risk for bleaching towels, clothes, and hair—a much disparaged
side effect of benzoyl peroxide.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Topical antibiotic formulations consisting of erythromycin or
clindamycin have been shown to be both effective and welltolerated
treatments for mild inflammatory acne. The use of
these agents alone, however, can be associated with the development
of bacterial resistance.<sup>41</sup> Combination products
with the addition of benzoyl peroxide have proven to be more
effective than either of the individual components alone
and are useful as either monotherapy for mild to moderate
acne or in addition to topical retinoids.<sup>42-44</sup></p>

<div class="story">

<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Oral antibiotics are a standard of care in the management of
moderate and severe acne and treatment-resistant forms of inflammatory
acne. In children less than 8 years of age, however,
the use of oral tetracycline, minocycline, or doxycycline is not
appropriate because of damage to developing bones and teeth.<sup>33</sup>
Consequently, practitioners are somewhat restricted in their
options for systemic therapy. Alternatives include erythromycin,
azithromycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Intralesional injection with corticosteroids can be used to
treat deep nodules and/or cysts.<sup>45</sup> Patients and their parents
should be counseled about possible atrophy at injection sites
and the risk of systemic absorption with subsequent adrenal
suppression.<sup>46</sup> Lowering the concentration and/or volume of
steroid (eg, choosing triamcinolone acetonide injection at a
concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in low volumes) may help to
minimize these complications.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Oral isotretinoin (Accutane) should be considered in cases of
nodulocystic acne, in the management of lesser degrees of
acne that are treatment-resistant, or for acne that is producing
either physical or psychological scarring at any age.<sup>33</sup>
Though approved only for patients 12 years and older by the
FDA, the use of oral isotretinoin in younger children and infants
is well-documented in the literature.<sup>19,47,48</sup> In one report
of 2 patients with cystic infantile acne, the dose of isotretinoin
ranged from 0.2 mg/kg/day to 1.5 mg/kg/day, and treatment
duration varied from 5 to 14 months.<sup>20</sup> Oral isotretinoin,
though usually well-tolerated in children, requires careful
monthly monitoring due to its many known side effects.</p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Administration of oral isotretinoin can be complicated in a
pediatric population, especially in the rare infant for whom
it may be indicated. The gelatin capsule forms are thermal
and light unstable, rendering the drug inactive if the capsules
are cut in attempts to deliver small doses to small children.
One method that can be utilized is to freeze a capsule to a
solid consistency and cut it into appropriate doses. These divided
doses may be hidden within a food such as a candy bar
to make administration more palatable.<sup>20</sup> Other recommended
methods include opening the capsules in dim light
and spreading it on a spoonful of warm milk<sup>19</sup> or a slice of
bread covered in butter and jam.<sup>48</sup></p>
<p class="articles-case-article-body">
Algorithms and guidelines exist for the medical management
of acne vulgaris. There may be a need in the very near
future to rewrite these therapy road maps as a new generation
of acne products emerges on the market. Topical retinoids in
combination with antibiotics, such as tretinoin with clindamycin
and adapalene with benzoyl peroxide offer the possibility
of new first-line therapies.</p>
